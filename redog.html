                        I’m so proud of Media Archaeology Lab undergraduate research assistant, @Strayer Russell, who was recognized with an award yesterday at the VCF Southwest! 
                        Strayer has only been a part of the Lab SINCE August 2024! From the moment he joined the lab, he took the initiative to work on restoring the READING EYE DOG, who we call REDog.
                        If you’re still at VCF Southwest today (Sunday, June 22) please find Strayer and REDog near the Media Archaelogy Lab in the ATC building for a demo!
                        In the rest of this post, I’m going to piggyback on this moment to present the backstory of “REDog and Me,” and how we ended up at UTD and VCF Southwest this year.
                        The backstory is also part of my professional history in the loosely defined “computer industry.”
                        REDog has been my avatar for my transformation as a researcher and innovator in cultural and creative technologies! 
                        REDog was originally created by a research lab at XEROX PARC in 1999; right around the time I joined the lab as a Principal Research Scientist. (How I got there is an even longer story; I’ll try to stick to the relevant bits for this context.)
                        The research lab was itself called RED, led by the brilliant PARC researcher Rich Gold. The RED lab was a stand-alone research unit supported by Xerox Chief Scientist, John Seely Brown, and Xerox Chief Technologist, Mark Weiser, names I assume are familiar to this community. 
                        RED’s mission was to prototype the technologies of (what was then) the imagined future of ubiquitous computing. My role in the Lab was to create the stories about the plausible future cultures that would take shape around these technologies. 
                        REDog was one of 13 speculative reading machines created by our Lab based on the bench computer science going on in other PARC labs during the 1990s. 
                        These speculative devices became part of an exhibit called “Experiments in the Future of Reading” that toured science/tech museums throughout the U.S. and Mexico from 2000-2004.
                        Fast forward: 
                        The dot com bust ignited the first researcher lay-offs at PARC during its 30-year history. Sixty research scientists of the 300 then on staff at PARC were let go, including all 7 of us in the RED Lab. 
                        As was common in the Valley during that age, three of us launched a start-up to commercialize some of the RED@PARC reading devices. 
                        As part of my severance package I negotiated a no-fee license, into perpetuity, to reproduce and further develop the devices. 
                        Fast-forward again: 
                        The work of RED, and then of our start-up (Onomy Labs) prefigured use-cases for the IBM touch table (aka The Surface) and the proliferation of glyph bar codes (aka the QRC). Our interactive museum exhibits demonstrated a new approach to the design of public interactives in sci/tech cultural institutions.
                        WHAT didn’t take root was the charming and evocative REDog.  
                        Although my start-up colleagues created versions of the REDog for Epcot and museums in Singapore and Mexico, REDog, to this day, remains a one-off marvel of the fusion of culture and (what was then) cutting edge integrated compute systems research.
                        I left the start-up when it became evident that I was never going to make ends meet as it struggled to fund the ongoing efforts of commercialization and research. The giant computer companies of the time had more resources of course.
                        After five years as a researcher and entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, I returned to academia to head a different sort of research unit at Univ of Southern California. When the start-up closed its space in Menlo Park in 2008, I officially adopted REDog. 
                        For the past 17-years, the 75+lb dog and its hassock has been with me as I relocated from LA, to NYC, and then, in 2016 to Dallas. 
                        During that span, its technology has been obsolesced and its CULTURAL significance has morphed from an example of speculative computing, to an emerging technology, to now an object of research in media archeology.
                        To return then to Stayer Russell’s recognition at VCF yesterday, it was so well deserved. 
                        He brings an academic background in software engineering to his current major in Art, Technology and Emerging Communication; this biography distinguishes him from many other comp sci students. 
                        He has the rare gift and grit required to make the vintage and obsolseced come back to (our) life. I will brag that this is characteristic of each of the five undergrad research assistants in the Lab. 
                        (blatant pitch: they all graduate next Spring, and will be looking for jobs in the field / industry!)
                        More personally, last evening was also a magic moment for me! 
                        His work on “TEACHING AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS” as a research assistant in my UTD Media Archaeology Lab makes me proud (of course), and reminds me again of the importance of efforts such as this VCF Southwest event to keep alive the tangible histories of our technology pasts, and to provide opportunities for really smart young people to find a community that groks them!
                        And, it probably goes without saying, this is one of small joys of being a teacher!
                        NOTE: If you are reading this well after VCF Southwest 2025 is over, and you would like a personal demonstration of REDog, contact me directly:
