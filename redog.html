                	<h3>Overview</h3>
		    	<p>This is a brief overview of the restoration of "Red" the Xerox PARC reading eye dog. A highly bespoke museum exhibit built as a forward
			looking, interactive, technological showcase in 1999.</p>
                    	<h3>Backstory and Functional Overview</h3>
			<p>Red 
                    	<h3>Initial Testing and Validation</h3>
			<p>I began my restoration by breaking Red down into his base components and deciding
			on an order of importance/testing.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dual Firewire (IIDC) eye cameras<li>
				<li>Firewire Interface Card<li>
				<li>Main Computer<li>
				<li>Control Button<li>
				<li>Speech Synthesizer<li>
			</ul>
			<p>The computer and speech synthesizer were the easiest to do initial validation of a both powered on successfully and performed some sort of
			"proof of life function" such as the speech synthesizer reading aloud a status message at boot "DECtalk express is running external power on",
			or the computer successfully making it to a desktop.</p>
			<p>I decided to start by working on the computer, speech synthsizer, and button as these would avoid the more complicated aspects of Red such as
			realtime image processing or OCR (optical character recognition) and allow me to get Red to a minimally interactable state (you push the button he says a line)
			in order to buy me time while I worked on the much more involved image processing. Verifying the function of the speech synthisizer was fairly simple as it is a
			fairly common model (a DECtalk Express) with the same controll commands used in many other products (the most notable of which being the Moonbase Alpha TTS, and 
			Stephen Hawking's assisted speaking rig). The button was also fairly simple, the most complicated aspect being having to reverse engineer the speed it was
			communicating with the computer at, which lead to me balancing my laptop on my knee repeatedly pushing the button while changing the controll speed untill
			the button output stopped being gibberish and made sense.
                    	<h3>Firewire Cameras and OCR</h3>
			<p>I am lumping the Camera interfacing and OCR under one section as computer based OCR has been a solved problem for a long time now. The desire for a computer to be
			able to extract the text from an image is a very common one and there are only so many ways to do it, so once I actually got the cameras working properly (a very long
			process as you will soon see) the OCR was an absolute cakewalk. The biggest limitation is that with Red still running on his original comptuer from 1999 the image processing
			takes a while, about 57 seconds is the longest I have timed, but this is also true to the original exhibit so I have elected to keep it authentic.</p>
                    	<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
		    	<p>As of now RED has been restored to a functional state. The button, cameras, and 
		    	speech synthesis all work. I would however like to make several improvements to the 
		    	overall system to make it more viable as an unmanned showpiece. 
		    	These improvements are summarized in the following list.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"Attract Mode"</li>
				<li>Ansible Playbook for Setup</li>
		    	</ul>
			<p>A minimal system image loaded from a flash disk improves the responsiveness of the
			system and makes Red less succeptable to issues relating to bumps, jolts, and powerloss
			Finally an Ansible-Playbook means that even if misfortune befalls Red that
			an alternative system image can be setup and configured rapidly allowing Red to return
			to display with minimal delay.</p>
