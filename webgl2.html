			<h2><a href="WebGL2PortfolioDemonstration.html">Live Demo</a></h2>
			<span class="image fit"><img src="./images/webgl2ArticleArt.png" alt="Image showing the Webgl 2 real time dithering demo including a canvas, and various UI elements such as buttons" /></span>
			<p>This is a demo application I created which captures the users screen with the getDisplayMedia() API and utilizes WebGl 2 to apply processing such as edge detection, luminance threshholding, and saturation 
				masking to this video stream in order to reduce the full color 24 bit per pixel video to one bit per pixel monochrome dithered image.
			</p>
			<p>This project was my first foray into the world of web based graphics API's and was primarily intended to farmiliarize myself with the API's and resources so that I would know the keywords and locations
				to find help in the future. This project is the precursor to my <a href="webgpu.html">WebGPU Realtime Dithering Demo</a> project which I created after becoming frustrated with the 
				limitations of WebGL2. I decided to continue with and finalize this project however as WebGL 2 is still incredibly relevant and more importantly widley supported by both browsers and the community.
				I much prefer the more modern and flexible WebGPU API but due to it's experimental status it is not a safe assumption that it will "Just Work" on all devices and browsers.
			</p>
			<p>This demo leverages the vertex and fragment shader stages of the webgpu render pipeline. The vertex shader is used to render a space for the video texture to be projected upon and the fragment shader is used to 
				apply the edge detection, luminance threshholding, and saturation masking to the video texture before crushing the color depth from the roughly 16 million colors of a 24 bit per pixel image to 2 colors of a 
				bitonal image. The primary differentiator between this project and the WebGPU project is the lack of a compute shader stage in the pipeline. This is due to the lack of support for compute shaders in WebGL2
				and nessecitates the reading back of the raw texture data to the CPU for further processing. This is a major bottleneck in the preformace of this project as WebGL2 is only garunteed to support the RGBA8 color
				format requiring a full 32 bits to be read over the bus for each pixel in the image despite each pixel only needing 1 bit of information. The lack of support for non grapics computation also requires the 32 bit
				to 1 bit compression to be done in Javascript on the CPU which is a much slower and less efficent process than the parallel processing of the GPU.
			</p>
			<p>Despite the shortcomings I feel that WebGL 2 has I still consider this project a success. I enjoyed developing with WebGPU much more but, deploying and testing my WebGPU application on other computers and systems was often a finnicky
				and frustrating process, often requiring enabling experimental support or in some cases downloading an entirley seperate browser. To the credit of WebGL 2 it worked nearly effortlessly on all devices and browsers that I tested it on 
				and I am confident that it will continue to do so for the forseeable future. I am also happy with the results of the project as it allowed me to experiment with different types of data processing and optimizations and I am proud of 
				the final product. Especially because I now know where my prefrences lie and which tools I have at my disposal for future projects so that I may select the "right tool for the job." for applications which demand high reliability and 
				portability over efficency and flexibility.
