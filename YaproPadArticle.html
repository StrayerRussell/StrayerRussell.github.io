							<p>The Yapro Pad web configurator is a dashboard meant for configuring the functions and settings of the Yapro Pad, an open source combination macropad, soundboard, and audio interface that I am currently developing.
								The purpose of the Yapro Pad is to provide a customizable and versatile tool for content creators, streamers, and anyone else who needs a tool for controlling their computer and audio setup at a much lower cost 
								than similar offerings such as the <a href="https://www.tc-helicon.com/product.html?modelCode=0803-AAA">Go XLR</a> or the <a href="https://elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck">Elgato Stream Deck</a>. There are many existing
								DIY and open source products and projects that aim to accomplish similar goals such as the <a href="https://github.com/SuperMakeSomething/diy-stream-deck">diy-stream-deck</a> but many of these lack the polish and ease of use
								of the original products they aim to replace. The Yapro Pad is designed from the ground up to maintain a high level of polish and ease of use withought sacrificing the customizability and versatility that comes with open source.
							</p>
							<p>The Web Configurator is the primary means of achieving this desired ease of use, providing a simple and intuitive GUI for configuring the functions and actions preformed by the pads peripherals. The configurator even allows the 
								specification of hardware device information such as the total number of sliders or keyboards the user has connected to their device allowing for totally custom builds. This is contrary to many of the other projects which require 
								the end user to modify the firmware and reflash the device whenever a change is desired or even requiring the user to install and configure another piece of software on their computer to interpret the hardcoded keypresses and control 
								signals sent by the device.The Yapro Pad requires only one extenal program to be installed on the computer and that is the <a href="https://github.com/omriharel/deej">Deej</a> audio control software which enables the optional control 
								of system apps typically innaccessible by hardware devices. All other functions of the Yapro Pad are prefromed by the device itself and are configured and controlled through the web configurator. persisting across reboots and even when 
								plugged into an entirley seperate computer.
